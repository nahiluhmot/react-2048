# React-2048

This application is a clone of 2048 implemented using React.
The core game logic is finished, but it lacks pretty styling.

## Running

The following steps will clone the application source, install dependencies, build the application, and run the web server.
These steps assume you're on a computer with node installed.

```shell
# Clone the source
$ git clone https://github.com:nahiluhmot/react-2048

# Install dependencies
$ cd react-2048
$ npm install

# Build the application and run the server
$ gulp serve
```

If you'd like to change the port on which the application runs, export the `PORT` environment variable to your desired port.
